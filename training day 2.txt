feb 1--------normalization
Normalization is a process of decomposing the relations into relations with fewer attributes.

in 1nf-------should be atomic that is we can decompose relationship should be there.
superkey---combination of candiate key

2nf
rule is creation of primary and non primary attribute
should not be partially dependent--both attributes need to fetch the record
eg student table

sid   sname  projid  projectname

primary key---sid,projid
so sid,projid,sname one table
projectid,projname

3nf
no transitive dependency

superkey should be  primary key

java---oops,jvm isnot plateform dependent
java virtual machine its the interpeter
state and behavior

state is data
method is behav
object is the instance of the class
A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.

class is combination of obj and method
class id bundle of primitives.
constructors--initialization,bound with the object

hashcode
class members,always aero,always get the value first,they are not object,called without object

prim to obj---  Integer i=new Integer(50);  
viceversa intValue()

autoboxing and unboxing
wrapperclass----

foreach----for(int i:arr1)
scanner
static function
nextint,nextdouble etc
list class
final
constant(c and cpp) and final(java)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
hashcode--wil be the same if the object has the same values
method-hashcode()
